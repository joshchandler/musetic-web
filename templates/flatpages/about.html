        <h3>About Musetic</h3>
	    <p>Musetic is a community/simple sharing platform made specifically for creators to share the things they've made (think Imgur, but for art in all its forms). Although anyone will be allowed to sign up and curate, only the original creators of the content will be allowed to submit.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>Musetic is in Beta.</h4>

        <p>When using Musetic during the Beta testing phase, you may occasionally run into bugs. A new feature may suddenly appear (we're trying to release new features constantly). That's the fun of the Musetic Beta experience â€” participating as Musetic rolls out from the beginning.</p>
